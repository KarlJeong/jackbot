#Reflection
This project is currently in development. The purpose of this project is building my personal trading bot working with few trading methodologies. <br>

The bot consists of collecting which gathers trading histories via API service provided by KIWOOM Securities Co., Ltd., simulator that simulate how much profit I could get with a certain methodology, and real trading bot.<br>

I am not sure this project works with great result at the end, but at least it could be nice try for me to build a system with Python.
